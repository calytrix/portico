                  Welcome to the Portico Build System

       The Portico build system is an artefact-driven, modular, Ant
       based system. The base framework is split up over a number of
       different build files (base structure, macros, etc...) and is
       designed to be extended rather than modified. The full system
       is introduced and described in the online documentation:

	<description>
		This is the parent C++ build file.

		Depending on the platform in use, the master build.xml file will import sets of
		other C++ build files that contain the specifics for building the various HLA
		interfaces on those platforms. The targets in those build files are declared to
		extend the extension points defined here.

		This file exists to declare these points so that "C++ wide" tasks can be invoked,
		causing all the appropriate children to be invoked with them. For example, this
		lets you call "cpp.sandbox" from the command line and have all the appropriate
		C++ sandbox targets run.
