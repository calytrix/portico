# The build process uses a build number for a number of tasks.
# The full version string is built from these two properties.
#
# e.g. To get "2.0-dev" you'd have:
#   app.version.number = 2.0
#   app.version.tag = -dev
#   
# You can override any of these values from the command line
# with the -Dapp.version.number=xxxx argument.
#
app.version.number=2.0
app.version.tag=-development
